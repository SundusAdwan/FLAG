# FLAG Framework for Flutter UI Automatic Generation

## Overview
Welcome to FLAG (Flutter UI Automatic Generation), a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the rapid development of cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter. This tool leverages Model-Based Development (MBD) principles, utilizing both Domain Specific Visual Language (DSVL) and Domain Specific Textual Language (DSTL) to enable the seamless transformation of graphical designs into functional code.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Create apps that are compatible with both Android and iOS from a single codebase.
- **Model-Based Generation**: Automatically generate Dart code from your visual models using our custom DSLs, enhancing productivity and reducing potential errors.
- **Visual Editor**: A powerful drag-and-drop interface lets you visually assemble UI components.
- **Extensibility**: Designed to be flexible and extendable, allowing for future growth as Flutter evolves and new requirements emerge.

## Detailed Installation Guide
Before you can utilize FLAG, make sure your system meets the following prerequisites:
